# Working with Data

This tutorial covers how to work with genomic data in BRC Analytics.

## Data Types

BRC Analytics supports several types of genomic data:

- **Reference Genomes** - Full genome sequences for organisms
- **Annotations** - Gene locations, transcripts, and other features
- **Sequencing Data** - Raw reads from sequencing experiments (FASTQ)
- **Alignments** - Mapped reads to reference genomes (BAM/SAM)
- **Variants** - Genetic variations (VCF)

## Accessing Reference Data

BRC Analytics provides pre-loaded reference data for many organisms:

1. Browse to the [Organisms](/data/organisms) page
2. Select an organism of interest
3. View the available assemblies and annotations

Example of accessing an assembly in code:

```typescript
import { fetchAssembly } from "@brc-analytics/api";

// Fetch a specific assembly by accession
const assembly = await fetchAssembly("GCF_000001405.39");

// Access assembly metadata
console.log(`Organism: ${assembly.organism.name}`);
console.log(`Version: ${assembly.version}`);
console.log(`Source: ${assembly.source}`);
```

## Importing External Data

You can import your own data to use with BRC Analytics:

### Importing from ENA

1. Go to the workflow configuration page
2. Select "Import from ENA" option
3. Enter accession numbers for your samples
4. Select the files to import

### Uploading Local Files

1. Select the "Upload Files" option in the workflow configuration
2. Use the file browser to select local files
3. Or provide URLs to download files from external sources

## Data Preparation

Before analysis, you may need to prepare your data:

### Quality Control

Checking the quality of sequencing data:

1. Use FastQC to assess read quality
2. Trim low-quality bases and adapters
3. Filter out low-quality reads

### Format Conversion

Converting between data formats:

1. Use Galaxy tools for format conversion
2. Common conversions include BAM to BED, GTF to BED, etc.

## Working with Large Datasets

Tips for handling large genomic datasets:

1. Use streaming tools when possible to reduce memory usage
2. Split large analyses into smaller batches
3. Consider downsampling for initial analysis

## Data Visualization

BRC Analytics offers several ways to visualize your data:

### UCSC Genome Browser

1. Select "View in Genome Browser" option for compatible data
2. Browse genomic regions with annotations
3. Add custom tracks for your analysis results

### Galaxy Visualization

1. Use built-in Galaxy visualization tools
2. Create interactive plots and charts
3. Generate genome browser views within Galaxy

## Data Sharing

Sharing your data with collaborators:

1. Create shared histories in Galaxy
2. Generate public links to specific datasets
3. Export data in standard formats for external sharing

## Data Security

BRC Analytics takes data security seriously:

1. All data transfers use encrypted connections
2. Account authentication protects your data
3. Data access controls determine who can view your data

## Best Practices

Recommendations for effective data management:

1. Document your data sources and processing steps
2. Use consistent naming conventions
3. Regularly back up important datasets
4. Clean up temporary files to free storage quota

export async function getStaticProps() {
  return {
    props: {
      pageTitle: meta.title + " - Learn BRC Analytics",
      themeOptions: {
        palette: { background: { default: "#FAFBFB" } }, // SMOKE_LIGHTEST
      },
    },
  };

}
