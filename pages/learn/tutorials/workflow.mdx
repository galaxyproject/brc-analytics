# Running a Workflow

This tutorial will guide you through the process of running a workflow in BRC Analytics.

## Overview

Workflows in BRC Analytics are pre-configured analysis pipelines that can be run on genomic data. They typically consist of several steps including:

1. Data preparation
2. Quality control
3. Analysis
4. Results visualization

## Selecting an Organism and Assembly

Before running a workflow, you'll need to select an organism and assembly to work with:

1. Navigate to the [Organisms](/data/organisms) page
2. Browse or search for your organism of interest
3. Select the organism to view available assemblies
4. Choose the assembly you want to work with

## Choosing a Workflow

Once you've selected an assembly:

1. Click on "Analyze" to view available workflows
2. Browse the available workflows for your assembly
3. Select a workflow that matches your analysis goals

## Configuring Workflow Inputs

After selecting a workflow, you'll need to configure the inputs:

```javascript
// Example of how workflow parameters might be configured
const workflowParams = {
  referenceGenome: "GRCh38",
  reads: ["sample1_R1.fastq", "sample1_R2.fastq"],
  threadCount: 4,
  minQuality: 20,
};
```

Basic steps include:

1. Upload or select input data files
2. Configure parameters specific to your analysis
3. Review all settings before launching

## Launching the Workflow

Once your workflow is configured:

1. Click "Run in Galaxy" to launch the workflow
2. You'll be redirected to Galaxy with your workflow pre-configured
3. Confirm the launch in the Galaxy interface

## Monitoring Progress

After launching:

1. Your workflow will be added to the Galaxy queue
2. You can monitor progress in the Galaxy interface
3. Each step will show its status (queued, running, completed)

## Viewing Results

When the workflow completes:

1. Results will be available in your Galaxy history
2. You can download results for local analysis
3. Many results can be visualized directly in Galaxy
4. Some results can be sent to the UCSC Genome Browser for further visualization

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Workflow Fails to Start

If your workflow doesn't start, check:

- That all required inputs are provided
- Your Galaxy account has sufficient quota
- The Galaxy server is operational

### Data Format Issues

If you encounter errors related to data formats:

- Ensure your input files match the expected format
- Check for common format issues like incorrect line endings
- Use Galaxy's format conversion tools if needed

## Next Steps

Now that you've run a basic workflow, you might want to:

- Learn about [working with data](/learn/tutorials/data) in more depth
- Explore more advanced workflows for specific analyses
- Share your results with collaborators
