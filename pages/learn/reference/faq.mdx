# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is BRC Analytics?

BRC Analytics is a collaborative effort of four mature software and infrastructure projects—Galaxy, HyPhy, UCSC Genome Browser, and TACC—providing a platform for bioinformatics research.

### Who can use BRC Analytics?

BRC Analytics is freely available to researchers worldwide. It's designed for bioinformaticians, computational biologists, and researchers working with genomic data.

### Is BRC Analytics open source?

Yes, BRC Analytics is open source. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/brc-analytics) and contributions are welcome.

### How do I cite BRC Analytics?

When citing BRC Analytics in your research, please use the following format:

> BRC Analytics Team (2025). BRC Analytics: A platform for bioinformatics research. Available at: https://brc-analytics.org

## Account Management

### Do I need an account to use BRC Analytics?

Basic browsing of organisms and assemblies does not require an account. However, to run workflows and save results, you'll need a Galaxy account.

### How do I create an account?

You can create an account by visiting [https://brc.usegalaxy.org](https://brc.usegalaxy.org) and clicking on "Login or Register" in the upper right corner.

### I forgot my password. How do I reset it?

You can reset your password by clicking on "Login or Register" and then selecting "Forgot password?" on the login page.

## Data & Analysis

### What organisms are available in BRC Analytics?

BRC Analytics includes a wide range of organisms, with a focus on pathogens and their hosts. You can browse the complete list on the [Organisms](/data/organisms) page.

### Can I upload my own data?

Yes, you can upload your own data to use with BRC Analytics workflows. This can be done during the workflow configuration process.

### Is my data private?

Yes, data you upload to Galaxy through BRC Analytics is private by default and only accessible to you unless you explicitly share it.

### What's the maximum file size I can upload?

The default file size limit is 5GB. If you need to work with larger files, consider:

1. Splitting the files into smaller chunks
2. Requesting a quota increase
3. Using the FTP upload option for very large files

## Workflows

### What types of analyses can I run?

BRC Analytics provides workflows for various analyses including:

- Variant discovery
- Transcriptomics
- Genome assembly
- Phylogenetic analysis
- Protein structure prediction

### How long do workflows take to run?

Workflow run times vary depending on:

- The complexity of the workflow
- The size of your input data
- Current server load
- Resource allocation

Simple workflows may complete in minutes, while complex analyses on large datasets can take hours or days.

### Can I create custom workflows?

Yes, you can create custom workflows in Galaxy after launching from BRC Analytics. These workflows can be saved for future use.

### Can I share my workflows with others?

Yes, workflows created in Galaxy can be shared with collaborators or published to the Galaxy workflow repository.

## Troubleshooting

### A workflow failed. What should I do?

If your workflow fails:

1. Check the error message in the Galaxy history
2. Verify that your input data is in the correct format
3. Ensure you have sufficient disk quota
4. For complex issues, consult the Galaxy Help Forum

### How do I report a bug?

Bugs can be reported on the [BRC Analytics GitHub Issues](https://github.com/galaxyproject/brc-analytics/issues) page. Please include:

- A detailed description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Any error messages
- Browser and OS information
