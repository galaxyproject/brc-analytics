# Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up your environment to work with BRC Analytics.

## Creating an Account

To use all features of BRC Analytics, you'll need a Galaxy account. This account will allow you to save workflows, histories, and share your work with collaborators.

### Sign Up Process

1. Visit [https://brc.usegalaxy.org](https://brc.usegalaxy.org)
2. Click on "Login or Register" in the upper right corner
3. Click on "Register here" to create a new account
4. Fill out the registration form with your email address and password
5. Verify your account through the confirmation email

## Setting Up Your Environment

BRC Analytics works best with:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- A stable internet connection
- Sufficient screen resolution (1280x720 or higher recommended)

### Storage Quotas

Your Galaxy account comes with a default storage quota. If you need additional storage for large analyses, you have several options:

- Request a quota increase through your profile settings
- Use external storage for large datasets
- Clean up old histories to free up space

## Connecting to External Resources

BRC Analytics integrates with several external resources:

### Connecting to Galaxy

Galaxy is tightly integrated with BRC Analytics. When you select an assembly and workflow, you'll be directed to Galaxy automatically with the appropriate reference data pre-configured.

### Connecting to UCSC Genome Browser

The UCSC Genome Browser is used for visualizing genomic data. You can:

1. View existing tracks on reference genomes
2. Upload your own data as custom tracks
3. Share sessions with collaborators

## Getting Support

If you encounter issues during setup, there are several support options available:

- **Documentation**: This documentation contains solutions to common problems
- **Community Forum**: Post questions to the [Galaxy help forum](https://help.galaxyproject.org)
- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs on the [BRC Analytics GitHub repository](https://github.com/galaxyproject/brc-analytics/issues)

## Next Steps
