      quality <30, PCR duplicates). Generates 5' cut site pileups (Â±100bp), performs
      peak calling, and quantifies reads in 1kb summit-centered regions. Produces two

    workflow_name: "COVID-19: variation analysis of ARTIC ONT data"
    workflow_description:
      This workflow for ONT-sequenced ARTIC data is modeled after
      the alignment/variant-calling steps of the [ARTIC pipeline](https://artic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
      It performs, essentially, the same steps as that pipelineâs minion command, i.e.
      read mapping with minimap2 and variant calling with medaka. Like the Illumina
      ARTIC workflow it uses ivar for primer trimming. Since ONT-sequenced reads have
      a much higher error rate than Illumina-sequenced reads and are therefor plagued
      more by false-positive variant calls, this workflow does make no attempt to handle
      amplicons affected by potential primer-binding site mutations.

    workflow_description:
      The workflow for Illumina-sequenced ARTIC data builds on the
      RNASeq workflow for paired-end data using the same steps for mapping and variant
      calling, but adds extra logic for trimming ARTIC primer sequences off reads with
      the ivar package. In addition, this workflow uses ivar also to identify amplicons
      affected by ARTIC primer-binding site mutations and tries to exclude reads derived
      from such tainted amplicons when calculating allele-frequencies of other variants.
