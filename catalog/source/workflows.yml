    workflow_name: "ATACseq"
    workflow_description: "This workflow takes as input a collection of paired fastq. It will remove bad quality and adapters with cutadapt. Map with Bowtie2 end-to-end. Will remove reads on MT and unconcordant pairs and pairs with mapping quality below 30 and PCR duplicates. Will compute the pile-up on 5'' +- 100bp. Will call peaks and count the number of reads falling in the 1kb region centered on the summit. Will compute 2 normalization for coverage: normalized by million reads and normalized by million reads in peaks. Will plot the number of reads for each fragment length."

    workflow_description: "This workflow takes as input a list of paired-end fastqs. Adapters and bad quality bases are removed with cutadapt. Reads are mapped with STAR with ENCODE parameters and genes are counted simultaneously as well as normalized coverage (per million mapped reads) on uniquely mapped reads. The counts are reprocessed to be similar to HTSeq-count output. FPKM are computed with cufflinks and/or with StringTie. The unstranded normalized coverage is computed with bedtools."

Reads are mapped with STAR with ENCODE parameters and genes are counted simultaneously as well as normalized coverage (per million mapped reads) on uniquely mapped reads. The counts are reprocessed to be similar to HTSeq-count output. Alternatively, featureCounts can be used to count the reads/fragments per gene. FPKM are computed with cufflinks and/or with StringTie. The unstranded normalized coverage is computed with bedtools."
