## Overview

Togaviridae is a family of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that includes important human and animal pathogens. The family consists of a single genus, Alphavirus, which includes chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and others. Most alphaviruses are arthropod-borne (arboviruses), primarily transmitted by mosquitoes.

Togaviridae has been designated as a prototype pathogen family for pandemic preparedness research by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). As part of the NIAID-funded Research and Development of Vaccines and Monoclonal Antibodies for Pandemic Preparedness (ReVAMPP) project, this viral family was prioritized due to its significant potential for causing outbreaks and public health emergencies. NIAID selected virus families of concern with insufficient research, inadequate medical countermeasures, and low to moderate historical support.

## Impact

- **Human Health**: Causes diseases ranging from mild febrile illness to severe encephalitis and arthritis
- **Geographic Distribution**: Worldwide, with specific viruses endemic to particular regions
- **Vectors**: Most members transmitted by mosquitoes
- **Emerging Threats**: Chikungunya has caused major outbreaks across multiple continents in recent decades
