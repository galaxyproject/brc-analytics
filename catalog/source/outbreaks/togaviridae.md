## Overview

Togaviridae is a family of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that includes important human and animal pathogens. The family consists of two genera: Alphavirus (which includes chikungunya virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, and others) and Rubivirus (which includes rubella virus). Most alphaviruses are arthropod-borne (arboviruses), primarily transmitted by mosquitoes.

Togaviridae has been designated as a prototype pathogen family for pandemic preparedness research, representing a viral group with significant potential for causing outbreaks and public health emergencies.

## Impact

- **Human Health**: Causes diseases ranging from mild febrile illness to severe encephalitis and arthritis
- **Geographic Distribution**: Worldwide, with specific viruses endemic to particular regions
- **Vectors**: Most members transmitted by mosquitoes
- **Congenital Disease**: Rubella can cause severe birth defects when infection occurs during pregnancy
- **Emerging Threats**: Chikungunya has caused major outbreaks across multiple continents in recent decades
- **Economic**: Significant healthcare costs and productivity losses due to long-term arthralgia
