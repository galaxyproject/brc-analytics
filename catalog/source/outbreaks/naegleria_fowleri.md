# Naegleria fowleri

## Overview

Naegleria fowleri is a free-living amoeba that causes Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM), an acute brain infection. It enters the nasal passages during freshwater activities and migrates to the brain.

## Impact

- **Public Health**: Extremely rare but highly fatal (95%+ case fatality rate)
- **Geography**: Historically in warm freshwater regions, expanding northward
- **Severity**: Destroys brain tissue, death occurs within days
- **Treatment**: No reliably effective treatments once symptoms begin
- **Climate Impact**: Cases potentially increasing with rising global temperatures
