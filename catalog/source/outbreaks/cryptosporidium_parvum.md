## Overview

Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that causes diarrheal illness, which can be severe in young children and immunocompromised individuals. It spreads through waterborne transmission, with oocysts that are resistant to chlorine.

## Impact

- **Public Health**: Leading cause of waterborne diarrheal outbreaks in the U.S.
- **Child Health**: Major contributor to child mortality and malnutrition
- **Geography**: Global distribution with significant impact in developing regions
- **Severity**: Can cause chronic, life-threatening diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals
- **Treatment**: Limited treatment options (nitazoxanide with variable efficacy)
