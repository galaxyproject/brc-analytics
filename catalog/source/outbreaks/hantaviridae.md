## Overview

Hantaviridae is a family of viruses primarily carried by rodents. These viruses can cause severe and sometimes fatal diseases in humans, including Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) and Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS). Unlike many other viral families, hantaviruses are not transmitted between humans but are primarily spread through contact with infected rodent urine, droppings, or saliva.

Hantaviridae has been designated as a prototype pathogen family for pandemic preparedness research, representing a viral group with significant potential for causing outbreaks and public health emergencies.

## Impact

- **Human Health**: Causes severe respiratory disease (HPS) in the Americas and kidney disease (HFRS) in Europe and Asia
- **Mortality**: HPS has a mortality rate of approximately 38%
- **Geographic Distribution**: Worldwide, with specific viruses endemic to particular regions
- **Reservoir Hosts**: Primarily carried by specific rodent species with long-term infections
- **Public Health**: Requires significant prevention efforts in endemic areas
- **Occupational Risk**: Higher risk for those working in rodent-infested areas
