## Overview

Picornaviridae is a family of small, non-enveloped viruses with positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes. This diverse family includes many significant human and animal pathogens, including poliovirus, rhinoviruses (common cold), enteroviruses, hepatitis A virus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus. The name "picorna" comes from "pico" (small) and "RNA," reflecting their tiny size and RNA genome. Most picornaviruses for which the natural hosts have been identified are specific for one, or a very few host species. Transmission by arthropod vectors is not known, although EMCV has been isolated from mosquitoes and ticks, and poliovirus from flies; therefore mechanical transmission may be possible.

Picornaviridae has been designated as a prototype pathogen family for pandemic preparedness research by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). As part of the NIAID-funded Research and Development of Vaccines and Monoclonal Antibodies for Pandemic Preparedness (ReVAMPP) project, this viral family was prioritized due to its significant potential for causing outbreaks and public health emergencies. NIAID selected virus families of concern with insufficient research, inadequate medical countermeasures, and low to moderate historical support.

## Impact

- **Human Health**: Causes a wide range of diseases from mild respiratory infections to severe neurological conditions
- **Agriculture**: Foot-and-mouth disease has devastating impacts on livestock industries
- **Public Health**: Several members require ongoing surveillance and vaccination programs
- **Neurological Disease**: Some enteroviruses cause paralysis, meningitis, and encephalitis
