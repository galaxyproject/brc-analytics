## Overview

Picornaviridae is a family of small, non-enveloped viruses with positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes. This diverse family includes many significant human and animal pathogens, including poliovirus, rhinoviruses (common cold), enteroviruses, hepatitis A virus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus. The name "picorna" comes from "pico" (small) and "RNA," reflecting their tiny size and RNA genome.

Picornaviridae has been designated as a prototype pathogen family for pandemic preparedness research, representing a viral group with significant potential for causing outbreaks and public health emergencies.

## Impact

- **Human Health**: Causes a wide range of diseases from mild respiratory infections to severe neurological conditions
- **Polio Eradication**: Global efforts to eradicate poliovirus have dramatically reduced but not yet eliminated this disease
- **Economic**: Common cold viruses (rhinoviruses) cause significant productivity losses worldwide
- **Agriculture**: Foot-and-mouth disease has devastating impacts on livestock industries
- **Public Health**: Several members require ongoing surveillance and vaccination programs
- **Neurological Disease**: Some enteroviruses cause paralysis, meningitis, and encephalitis
