# Mpox

## Overview

Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a viral zoonotic disease caused by the mpox virus. Historically, it caused sporadic outbreaks in Central and West African countries. In 2022, it emerged as a large multinational outbreak, growing from a handful of cases to over 80,000 confirmed cases across more than 100 countries by late 2022. This prompted the WHO to declare a Public Health Emergency.

## Impact

- **Public Health**: Global outbreak with cases in multiple countries
- **Healthcare**: Increased demand for diagnostic testing and treatment
- **Community**: Disproportionate impact on certain populations
- **Travel**: Enhanced screening at international borders
- **Mortality**: Case-fatality rate \<0.1% in non-endemic countries (2022), ~10% in Africa for more virulent clades
