## Overview

Nairoviridae is a family of arthropod-borne viruses that includes several important human and animal pathogens. The most notable member is Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), which causes severe hemorrhagic disease in humans. These viruses are characterized by their segmented, negative-sense RNA genomes and transmission primarily through tick vectors.

Nairoviridae has been designated as a prototype pathogen family for pandemic preparedness research by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). As part of the NIAID-funded Research and Development of Vaccines and Monoclonal Antibodies for Pandemic Preparedness (ReVAMPP) project, this viral family was prioritized due to its significant potential for causing outbreaks and public health emergencies. NIAID selected virus families of concern with insufficient research, inadequate medical countermeasures, and low to moderate historical support.

## Impact

- **Human Health**: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has a high mortality rate (10-40%)
- **Geographic Range**: Widespread across Africa, the Balkans, Middle East, and Asia
- **Vectors**: Primarily transmitted by Hyalomma ticks
- **Healthcare**: Poses significant nosocomial infection risk to healthcare workers
- **Public Health**: Requires specialized containment facilities for handling
