## Overview

Nairoviridae is a family of tick-borne viruses that includes several important human and animal pathogens. The most notable member is Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), which causes severe hemorrhagic disease in humans. These viruses are characterized by their segmented, negative-sense RNA genomes and transmission primarily through tick vectors.

Nairoviridae has been designated as a prototype pathogen family for pandemic preparedness research, representing a viral group with significant potential for causing outbreaks and public health emergencies.

## Impact

- **Human Health**: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has a high mortality rate (10-40%)
- **Geographic Range**: Widespread across Africa, the Balkans, Middle East, and Asia
- **Vectors**: Primarily transmitted by Hyalomma ticks
- **Agriculture**: Affects livestock productivity in endemic regions
- **Healthcare**: Poses significant nosocomial infection risk to healthcare workers
- **Public Health**: Requires specialized containment facilities for handling
