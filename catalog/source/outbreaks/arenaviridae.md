## Overview

Arenaviridae is a family of viruses that includes several important human pathogens. These viruses are primarily rodent-borne and can cause hemorrhagic fevers in humans. The family name comes from the Latin "arenosus," meaning sandy, which refers to the grainy appearance of virions under electron microscopy due to ribosomes inside the viral particles.

Arenaviridae has been designated as a prototype pathogen family for pandemic preparedness research by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). As part of the NIAID-funded Research and Development of Vaccines and Monoclonal Antibodies for Pandemic Preparedness (ReVAMPP) project, this viral family was prioritized due to its significant potential for causing outbreaks and public health emergencies. NIAID selected virus families of concern with insufficient research, inadequate medical countermeasures, and low to moderate historical support.

## Impact

- **Human Health**: Several members cause severe hemorrhagic fevers with high mortality rates
- **Endemic Regions**: Primarily in South America (Junin, Machupo, Guanarito viruses) and Africa (Lassa virus)
- **Transmission**: Primarily through contact with infected rodent excreta or person-to-person spread
- **Public Health**: Significant burden in endemic areas with limited treatment options
- **Research**: Important models for studying viral hemorrhagic fevers and immune responses
