## Overview

Aspergillus molds are ubiquitous in the environment and cause a range of diseases, from allergies to deadly invasive infections. A. fumigatus is the most common cause of invasive aspergillosis in immunosuppressed patients.

## Impact

- **Public Health**: ~1.5 million deaths annually from serious fungal diseases, including invasive aspergillosis
- **Mortality**: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis has ~50% mortality even with treatment
- **Geography**: Global distribution with significant impact in healthcare settings
- **Antifungal Resistance**: Emerging resistance complicates treatment
- **Toxins**: A. flavus produces aflatoxin, contributing to liver cancer risk
