## Overview

Flaviviridae is a family of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that includes numerous important human pathogens. Notable members include dengue virus, Zika virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis C virus. Many flaviviruses are arthropod-borne (arboviruses), primarily transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks, while others like hepatitis C are transmitted through blood and other body fluids.

Flaviviridae has been designated as a prototype pathogen family for pandemic preparedness research, representing a viral group with significant potential for causing outbreaks and public health emergencies.

## Impact

- **Human Health**: Causes a wide range of diseases from mild febrile illness to severe hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and chronic liver disease
- **Geographic Distribution**: Worldwide, with many members endemic to tropical and subtropical regions
- **Vectors**: Many members transmitted by mosquitoes (Aedes and Culex species) or ticks
- **Emerging Threats**: Several members have caused major outbreaks in recent decades (Zika, dengue, West Nile)
- **Economic**: Significant healthcare costs and productivity losses
- **Chronic Disease**: Hepatitis C is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer worldwide
