## Overview

Leishmania donovani complex causes visceral leishmaniasis (VL), the most severe form of leishmaniasis. Transmitted by sandfly bites, it affects poor, rural populations in South Asia, East Africa, and Brazil. NIAID prioritizes VL as a neglected tropical disease, focusing on developing better drugs and therapeutics. Despite being geographically limited, VL remains a deadly disease of poverty with high untreated fatality rates.

## Impact

- **Public Health**: ~50,000–90,000 new cases annually worldwide
- **Geography**: Endemic in South Asia, East Africa, and Brazil
- **Mortality**: Typically fatal if untreated
- **Treatment**: Increasing reports of treatment failure in India
- **Control**: Risk of resurgence if control measures lapse
