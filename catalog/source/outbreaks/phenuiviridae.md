## Overview

Phenuiviridae is a family of segmented, negative-strand RNA viruses that includes several important human and animal pathogens. The most notable member is Rift Valley fever virus, which causes significant disease in both livestock and humans. These viruses are primarily transmitted by arthropod vectors, especially mosquitoes and ticks.

Phenuivirids are remarkably diverse ecologically, infecting a wide range of hosts including humans, livestock, birds, crustaceans, plants, and fungi. Many are found in arthropods, which may serve as either unique hosts or biological vectors for transmission to other organisms. The family includes significant pathogens affecting human health, livestock production, seafood industries, and agricultural crops.

Phenuiviridae has been designated as a prototype pathogen family for pandemic preparedness research by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). As part of the NIAID-funded Research and Development of Vaccines and Monoclonal Antibodies for Pandemic Preparedness (ReVAMPP) project, this viral family was prioritized due to its significant potential for causing outbreaks and public health emergencies. NIAID selected virus families of concern with insufficient research, inadequate medical countermeasures, and low to moderate historical support.

## Impact

- **Human Health**: Causes febrile illness and occasionally severe complications like hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis
- **Agriculture**: Significant impact on livestock with high mortality in young animals and abortion in pregnant animals
- **Economic**: Major economic losses in affected agricultural regions
- **Geographic Distribution**: Primarily Africa, with recent spread to Arabian Peninsula
- **Vectors**: Transmitted by multiple mosquito species
- **Public Health**: Potential for epidemics when environmental conditions favor vector populations
