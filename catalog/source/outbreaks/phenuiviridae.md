## Overview

Phenuiviridae is a family of segmented, negative-strand RNA viruses that includes several important human and animal pathogens. The most notable member is Rift Valley fever virus, which causes significant disease in both livestock and humans. These viruses are primarily transmitted by arthropod vectors, especially mosquitoes and ticks.

Phenuiviridae has been designated as a prototype pathogen family for pandemic preparedness research, representing a viral group with significant potential for causing outbreaks and public health emergencies.

## Impact

- **Human Health**: Causes febrile illness and occasionally severe complications like hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis
- **Agriculture**: Significant impact on livestock with high mortality in young animals and abortion in pregnant animals
- **Economic**: Major economic losses in affected agricultural regions
- **Geographic Distribution**: Primarily Africa, with recent spread to Arabian Peninsula
- **Vectors**: Transmitted by multiple mosquito species
- **Public Health**: Potential for epidemics when environmental conditions favor vector populations
