## Overview

Paramyxoviridae is a family of enveloped, negative-sense RNA viruses that includes several significant human and animal pathogens. Notable members include measles virus, mumps virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, and the highly virulent Nipah and Hendra viruses. These viruses are responsible for a range of respiratory and systemic diseases in humans and animals.

Paramyxoviridae has been designated as a prototype pathogen family for pandemic preparedness research, representing a viral group with significant potential for causing outbreaks and public health emergencies.

## Impact

- **Human Health**: Causes widespread respiratory illnesses, childhood diseases, and emerging zoonotic infections
- **Vaccination**: Several members are targets of routine childhood vaccination programs
- **Mortality**: Measles remains a leading cause of vaccine-preventable childhood mortality globally
- **Emerging Threats**: Nipah and Hendra viruses have high mortality rates and pandemic potential
- **Economic**: Significant healthcare costs associated with respiratory infections
- **Public Health**: Requires ongoing surveillance and vaccination campaigns
