## Overview

Peribunyaviridae is a family of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that includes several important human and animal pathogens. These viruses have a tripartite, negative-sense RNA genome and are primarily transmitted by mosquitoes and other arthropod vectors. Notable members include La Crosse virus, California encephalitis virus, and Bunyamwera virus.

Peribunyaviridae has been designated as a prototype pathogen family for pandemic preparedness research, representing a viral group with significant potential for causing outbreaks and public health emergencies.

## Impact

- **Human Health**: Causes encephalitis, particularly in children (La Crosse virus)
- **Geographic Distribution**: Worldwide, with specific viruses endemic to particular regions
- **Vectors**: Primarily transmitted by mosquitoes
- **Seasonality**: Outbreaks typically occur during mosquito season
- **Agriculture**: Some members cause significant disease in livestock
- **Public Health**: Requires vector control measures in endemic areas
