## Overview

Peribunyaviridae is a family of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that includes several important human and animal pathogens. These viruses have a tripartite, negative-sense RNA genome and are primarily transmitted by mosquitoes and other arthropod vectors. Notable members include La Crosse virus, California encephalitis virus, and Bunyamwera virus.

These viruses are remarkably ecologically diverse, having been identified on every continent except Antarctica. They interact with a wide range of arthropod and vertebrate hosts, demonstrating significant adaptability. Clinical outcomes from peribunyavirus infections vary widely, from subclinical cases to fatal disease. In mammals, these viruses often target specific organs or cell types. An important characteristic of peribunyaviruses is their ability to undergo genetic reassortment both in laboratory settings and in nature, with such reassortment events being linked to outbreaks of human disease, particularly within the Orthobunyavirus genus.

Peribunyaviridae has been designated as a prototype pathogen family for pandemic preparedness research by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). As part of the NIAID-funded Research and Development of Vaccines and Monoclonal Antibodies for Pandemic Preparedness (ReVAMPP) project, this viral family was prioritized due to its significant potential for causing outbreaks and public health emergencies. NIAID selected virus families of concern with insufficient research, inadequate medical countermeasures, and low to moderate historical support.

## Impact

- **Human Health**: May cause encephalitis, particularly in children (La Crosse virus)
- **Geographic Distribution**: Worldwide, with specific viruses endemic to particular regions
- **Vectors**: Primarily transmitted by mosquitoes
- **Seasonality**: Outbreaks typically occur during mosquito season
- **Agriculture**: Some members cause significant disease in livestock
- **Public Health**: Requires vector control measures in endemic areas
