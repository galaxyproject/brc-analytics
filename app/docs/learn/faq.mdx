## What if my organism/assembly isn't available?

If your organism or assembly isn't currently available in BRC-Analytics,
you have several options. First, check if an
alternate assembly version is available that might meet your needs.
If not, you can contact our support team to request that your organism
be added to our database. We regularly update our collection based on
user requests and emerging research priorities.

## What analyses are available through BRC-Analytics?

BRC-Analytics provides a comprehensive suite of genomic analysis tools,
including:

- Gene annotation and functional characterization
- Variant calling and analysis
- RNA-seq differential expression analysis
- Regulation and epigenetic analysis

In addition, analyses that will be added in the near future include these
topics:

- Phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis
- Protein structure prediction
  Our platform is continuously expanding with new
  analysis capabilities based on the latest bioinformatics methods
  and user feedback.

## What if I want to do some other analysis?

We understand that research needs are diverse and constantly evolving.
If you need an analysis that isn't currently available in BRC-Analytics,
we encourage you to reach out to our team through our feedback system.
We actively prioritize new feature development based on community
requests. In the meantime, BRC-Analytics has the concept of a
"Custom Analysis", where, after you've selected your organism
and assembly of interest and any supporting data (like gene annotations
from UCSC or RNA-Seq reads from ENA), BRC-Analytics will transfer all
of that information to Galaxy where you can run any analysis you like.

## Can I do pangenomes or other types of comparative genomics?

In the near future, yes. BRC-Analytics will include robust comparative
genomics capabilities, including pangenome analysis. You will be able
to compare multiple genomes to identify core and accessory genes,
perform whole-genome alignments, and visualize synteny relationships.
Our pangenome tools will allow you to analyze gene presence/absence
patterns, identify lineage-specific genes, and explore genomic diversity
across populations or species. We will also support phylogenomic analysis,
ortholog identification, and comparative pathway analysis to help you
understand evolutionary relationships and functional differences
between genomes.
