## Data Management Tips

### Organizing Your Histories

- **Create separate histories** for different projects or experiments
- **Name histories descriptively** (e.g., "Measles_Surveillance_2024")
- **Add tags** to datasets for easy filtering
- **Delete unnecessary files** to manage storage

### Saving and Exporting Data

- **Download results** by clicking the download icon on any dataset
- **Export workflows** for reproducibility
- **Share histories** with collaborators via Galaxy's sharing features
- **Publish analyses** to make them publicly accessible

## Understanding Galaxy Basics

Since BRC Analytics runs on Galaxy, understanding these fundamentals is helpful:

### The Three-Panel Interface

1. **Left panel (Tools)**: Available analysis tools and workflows
2. **Middle panel (Main)**: Tool forms, visualizations, and documentation
3. **Right panel (History)**: Your datasets and analysis outputs

### Datasets

- Each file in your history is a dataset
- Color coding indicates status:
  - **Gray**: Waiting to run
  - **Yellow**: Running
  - **Green**: Successfully completed
  - **Red**: Failed (click for error details)

### Collections

- Group related datasets together
- Useful for batch processing multiple samples
- Created automatically for paired-end reads or can be manually created for grouping

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Analysis Failed (Red Dataset)

1. Click on the red dataset
2. Review the error message
3. Common causes:
   - Incorrect file format
   - Invalid parameter values
   - Insufficient computational resources
4. Adjust settings and re-run

### Dataset Stuck in Gray/Yellow

- Jobs are queued - be patient
- Check the Galaxy status page for system issues
- If stuck >24 hours, report to support

### Can't Find My Data

- Check you're viewing the correct history
- Use the search function in the history panel
- Datasets may be hidden - click "Include hidden datasets"

### Results Don't Look Right

- Verify input data quality
- Check parameter settings
- Compare with expected reference
- Review QC reports for issues

## Best Practices

### For Reproducible Research

1. **Document parameters**: Note all settings used
2. **Extract workflows**: Save your analysis pipeline
3. **Record provenance**: Galaxy automatically tracks this
4. **Share complete histories**: Include all inputs and parameters
5. **Publish workflows**: Make methods available to others

### For Efficient Analysis

1. **Start small**: Test with a subset of data
2. **Use collections**: Process multiple samples together
3. **Delete intermediate files**: Keep only essential outputs
4. **Monitor job status**: Check for errors early
5. **Save important results**: Download completed analyses

### For Quality Results

1. **Always run QC first**: Assess data quality
2. **Use appropriate references**: Match your organism
3. **Validate results**: Check consistency across samples
4. **Review annotations carefully**: Understand variant impacts
5. **Consult documentation**: Each tool has specific requirements
