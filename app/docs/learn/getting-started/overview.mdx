## What is BRC Analytics?

BRC Analytics is a browser-based bioinformatics platform that makes advanced pathogen genomics accessible to researchers without requiring programming experience or local software installation. Built on the Galaxy workflow system and funded by NIAID as part of the Bioinformatics Resource Centers for Infectious Diseases Program, it unifies reference data from NCBI Datasets with curated community workflows, allowing you to analyze genomic data entirely in your web browser.

### Key Features

- **No installation required** - Everything runs in your browser
- **Free public computational resources** - No additional investment needed
- **5,000+ genome assemblies** covering nearly 2,000 pathogen, host, and vector taxa
- **Integrated reference data** from authoritative sources like NCBI and UCSC
- **Community-curated workflows** for quality control, read mapping, variant identification, and annotation
- **Built-in analysis tools** including JupyterLite notebooks for custom analyses
- **Reproducible research** with automatic provenance tracking

## Before You Begin

### System Requirements

- A modern web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Edge)
- Stable internet connection
- No special hardware or software needed
