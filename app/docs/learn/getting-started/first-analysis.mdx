## Variant Calling from Sequencing Data

This walkthrough demonstrates how to perform pathogen surveillance analysis using the measles virus example from the featured analysis.

### Step 1: Select Your Organism

1. From the BRC Analytics homepage, navigate to **"Organisms"**
2. Use the search or browse function to find your organism of interest
   - Example: Search for "Measles morbillivirus"
3. Click on the organism to view available assemblies

### Step 2: Choose a Reference Assembly

1. Review the available genome assemblies from NCBI
2. Select the appropriate reference assembly for your analysis
   - Assemblies include metadata like assembly level, genome size, and annotation
3. Click **"View"**, select **"UCSC Genome Browser"** to explore the genome visually (optional)

### Step 3: Select a Workflow

BRC Analytics provides curated workflows for common analyses:

- **Variant Discovery** - Identify genetic variants from sequencing data
- **Quality Control** - Assess sequencing data quality
- **Read Mapping** - Align reads to reference genomes
- **Annotation** - Functionally annotate variants
- **Transcriptomics** - Analyze gene expression
- **Epigenetics** - Study DNA modifications
- **Assembly** - Construct genome sequences

For this example, select the **"Variant calling and consensus construction from paired end short read data"** workflow.

### Step 4: Get Your Data

BRC Analytics can access data from:

#### Option A: Public SRA Data

1. Click **"Search SRA"** to access the Sequence Read Archive
2. Enter search terms (e.g., "measles virus surveillance")
3. Filter results by:
   - Date range
   - Geographic location
   - Study type
   - Read length
4. Select datasets by checking boxes
5. The platform will automatically retrieve the data

#### Option B: Upload Your Own Data

1. Navigate to the Galaxy interface
2. Click **"Upload Data"** in the left panel
3. Choose your file source:
   - Local files from your computer
   - Paste URLs
   - Import from FTP
4. Select your files (FASTQ format for sequencing reads)
5. Click **"Start"** to upload
6. Return to BRC Analytics to configure the workflow parameters

### Step 5: Configure Workflow Parameters

The workflow interface will display configurable parameters:

**Common parameters include:**

- **Base quality threshold** - Minimum quality score for variant calling (typically 20-30)
- **Allele frequency threshold** - Minimum frequency to call a variant (e.g., 0.05 for 5%)
- **Read depth** - Minimum coverage required
- **Trimming options** - Adapter removal and quality trimming settings

**For the measles virus variant workflow:**

1. Review default parameters (optimized for viral genomes)
2. Adjust thresholds if needed for your specific analysis
3. The workflow will automatically:
   - Trim adapter sequences
   - Map reads to the reference genome
   - Call variants with iVar
   - Generate consensus sequences
   - Annotate variants with SnpEff
   - Produce quality control reports with MultiQC

### Step 6: Launch the Analysis

1. Review your selections:
   - Reference genome
   - Input data
   - Workflow
   - Parameters
2. Click **"Run Workflow"**
3. You'll be redirected to Galaxy where the analysis will execute
4. Monitor progress in your Galaxy history panel (right side)

### Step 7: View Results

Analysis outputs include:

**Primary Results:**

- **Trimmed reads** - Quality-filtered sequencing data
- **BAM files** - Mapped and aligned reads
- **VCF files** - Annotated variant calls with summary tables
- **Consensus FASTA** - Per-sample consensus sequences
- **QC reports** - Integrated quality metrics

**Accessing results:**

1. Click on any dataset in your history to expand details
2. Click the eye icon to view data
3. Click the download icon to save locally
4. Click the info icon for provenance and parameters
