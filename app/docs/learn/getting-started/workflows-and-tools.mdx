## Common Workflows

### Quality Control Workflow

**Purpose**: Assess sequencing data quality before analysis

**Steps:**

1. Select organism and assembly
2. Choose "QC Workflow"
3. Upload or select FASTQ files
4. Run workflow
5. Review MultiQC report for:
   - Read quality scores
   - Adapter content
   - Sequence duplication
   - GC content

### Read Mapping Workflow

**Purpose**: Align sequencing reads to reference genome

**Key parameters:**

- Choose aligner (BWA-MEM, Bowtie2, HISAT2, STAR)
- Set mapping quality thresholds
- Configure paired-end vs single-end

### Variant Discovery Pipeline

**Purpose**: Complete variant identification from raw reads

**Includes:**

1. Quality control
2. Read mapping
3. Variant calling
4. Annotation
5. Summary reports

## Advanced Features

### Using JupyterLite for Custom Analyses

BRC Analytics includes integrated JupyterLite notebooks for advanced analysis:

1. From your Galaxy history, locate the dataset you want to analyze
2. Click on the dataset and select **"Visualize"**
3. Choose **"JupyterLite Notebook"**
4. Write Python code to perform custom analyses
5. Example analyses include:
   - Statistical testing
   - Data visualization
   - Custom filtering
   - Evolutionary analysis

### Creating and Sharing Workflows

You can extract your analysis as a reusable workflow:

1. In Galaxy, click the **history options** menu (gear icon)
2. Select **"Extract Workflow"**
3. Choose which steps to include
4. Name your workflow
5. Save and share with collaborators

### Visualizing Results in UCSC Genome Browser

1. From Galaxy, select your BAM or VCF file
2. Click **"Visualize"** and choose **"UCSC Genome Browser"**
3. Your data will load as a custom track
4. Explore alongside reference annotations
5. Zoom, scroll, and configure display settings

## Example Use Cases

### Outbreak Surveillance

Monitor pathogen evolution by:

1. Downloading recent SRA surveillance data
2. Running variant calling workflow
3. Comparing variants across samples
4. Identifying emerging mutations
5. Visualizing on genome browser

### Comparative Genomics (available soon!)

Compare strains or species:

1. Select multiple genome assemblies
2. Run alignment workflows
3. Identify conserved regions
4. Analyze variant patterns
5. Perform evolutionary analysis in JupyterLite

### Transcriptome Analysis

Analyze gene expression:

1. Upload RNA-seq data
2. Run transcriptomics workflow
3. Quantify gene expression
4. Identify differentially expressed genes
5. Visualize results
