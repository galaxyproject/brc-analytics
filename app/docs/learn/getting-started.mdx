## Your First Analysis: Variant Calling from Sequencing Data

This walkthrough demonstrates how to perform pathogen surveillance analysis using the measles virus example from the featured analysis.

### Step 1: Select Your Organism

1. From the BRC Analytics homepage, navigate to **"Organisms"**
2. Use the search or browse function to find your organism of interest
   - Example: Search for "Measles morbillivirus"
3. Click on the organism to view available assemblies

### Step 2: Choose a Reference Assembly

1. Review the available genome assemblies from NCBI
2. Select the appropriate reference assembly for your analysis
   - Assemblies include metadata like assembly level, genome size, and annotation
3. Click **"View"**, select **"UCSC Genome Browser"** to explore the genome visually (optional)

### Step 3: Select a Workflow

BRC Analytics provides curated workflows for common analyses:

- **Variant Discovery** - Identify genetic variants from sequencing data
- **Quality Control** - Assess sequencing data quality
- **Read Mapping** - Align reads to reference genomes
- **Annotation** - Functionally annotate variants
- **Transcriptomics** - Analyze gene expression
- **Epigenetics** - Study DNA modifications
- **Assembly** - Construct genome sequences

For this example, select the **"Variant calling and consensus construction from paired end short read data"** workflow.

### Step 4: Get Your Data

BRC Analytics can access data from:

#### Option A: Public SRA Data

1. Click **"Search SRA"** to access the Sequence Read Archive
2. Enter search terms (e.g., "measles virus surveillance")
3. Filter results by:
   - Date range
   - Geographic location
   - Study type
   - Read length
4. Select datasets by checking boxes
