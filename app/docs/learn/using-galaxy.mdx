## The What and Why of Galaxy

Galaxy is a free, open-source system for analyzing data, authoring workflows, training and education, publishing tools, managing infrastructure, and more.

[UseGalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org) is the computational user interface of BRC-Analytics, with computing power provided by the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://tacc.utexas.edu). This combination provides you with considerable computational power to do the analysis you want to do.

## Using Galaxy

If you've looked at the [Getting Started](/learn/getting-started) document, you probably noticed that the way BRC-Analytics works is to allow you to pick the parameters of your analysis here (things like organism, assembly, workflow, starting data), and then that information is sent to UseGalaxy.org to begin processing.
As noted in [Creating an Account](/learn/getting-started#creating-an-account) section, the main thing you'll want to do with Galaxy before you get started is create an account on the [UseGalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org) site for your information to be sent to.

After creating an account, you will also likely want learn a little bit about how Galaxy works. The best place to start with that is the [Get Started](https://galaxyproject.org/get-started) document on the Galaxy website, and then you can also checkout the [The Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org) (GTN) that has MANY tutorials with example data and videos to help you get started and more.
