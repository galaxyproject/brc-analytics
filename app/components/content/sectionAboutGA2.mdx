            [The Galaxy team](https://github.com/orgs/galaxyproject/people) is a
            community that develops software infrastructure for deploying Galaxy
            instances. There are three major Galaxy instances in the US
            ([https://usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org)), Europe
            ([https://usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu)), and Australia
            ([https://usegalaxy.au.org](https://usegalaxy.au.org)) and many
            regional instances.

            Galaxy is an application that allows users to
            run a wide variety of command-line, web-based, or interactive tools
            on any type of compatible data. Galaxy can be accessed either
            through a web-browser, or programmatically via application
            programming interface (API). A Galaxy instance can be configured to
            manage local or remote computational resources, and schedule tool
            runs on any modern computational infrastructure including local
            hardware, conventional clusters, commercial or public clouds, and
            beyond.

            The Galaxy team also operates and maintains the Galaxy
            [ToolShed](https://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/)—a growing repository
            of >8,500 analysis tools available for use in Galaxy. The ToolShed
            is closely aligned with the [BioConda](https://bioconda.github.io)
            and [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro) communities that
            package and have become the standard distribution channels for
            bioinformatics tools. The Galaxy software ecosystem also includes
            scheduling components, tool development utilities, training
            infrastructure, and many other features (e.g.,
            [Planemo](https://planemo.readthedocs.io),
            [Pulsar](https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar),
            [TPV](https://github.com/galaxyproject/total-perspective-vortex)).

            The main public [https://usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org) site
            is an example of a Galaxy instance. Usegalaxy.org supports 10s of
            thousands of active users running 100s of thousands of jobs per month
            and manages over 4 petabytes of user data.

            [The Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org) (GTN) contains a
            comprehensive collection of tutorials covering all aspects of Galaxy
            from basic functionality to advanced analyses—it is a widely used
            community-curated resource.

            [The UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu), maintained by
            the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), is a widely used
            and highly regarded online tool for visualizing and exploring
            genomic information. It is one of the most widely used sources of
            genomic data in the world, with more than 150,000 monthly users,
            spread over 200 countries and the majority of usage coming from
            outside the United States. The Browser team has been generating and
            distributing multiple alignments for genomes distributed on the
            site.

          <AccordionDetails>
            [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://tacc.utexas.edu) (TACC)
            located within the University of Texas at Austin, serves as an
            advanced computing research hub. It offers an extensive array of
            advanced computing resources and support services to researchers
            across the United States. TACC's overarching objective is to
            facilitate groundbreaking discoveries that drive advancements in
            both science and society, achieved through the utilization of
            cutting-edge computing technologies.

            The center supports diverse
            areas, including high-performance computing, scientific
            visualization, data analysis, and storage systems, as well as
            software development, research initiatives, and the creation of
            user-friendly portal interfaces.

            TACC is a center of excellence in
            computational sciences within the US. Its resources and services are
            made accessible to the wider academic community through its
            participation in the National Science Foundation's (NSF)
            [ACCESS-CI](https://access-ci.org) project.

            [Jetstream2](https://jetstream-cloud.org/about/), led by [the
            Pervasive Technology Institute](https://pti.iu.edu/) at Indiana
            University, adds cloud-based, on-demand computing and data analysis
            resources to the national cyberinfrastructure. It expands this
            cyberinfrastructure to communities who have not had previous HPC
            experience or an easy route to harness the massive compute power
            research now demands.

            With a focus on ease of use and broad accessibility, Jetstream2 is
            designed for those who have not previously used high performance
            computing and software resources. The system is particularly geared
            toward 21st-century workforce development at small colleges and
            universities—especially historically black colleges and universities,
            minority serving institutions, tribal colleges, and higher education
            institutions in [EPSCoR states](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/epscor/state-websites).

            Jetstream2 is a flexible, user-friendly cloud computing environment
            available to US-based researchers and educators at no cost through
            support from the National Science Foundation's Advanced Cyberinfrastructure
            Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support ([ACCESS](https://access-ci.org/)) program.

      The research team responsible for implementing this work is headed by five
      PIs with complementary research expertise domains, and a long history of
      collaboration. It includes Dr. Nekrutenko (Penn State), the original
      co-developer and PI of the Galaxy Project for the past 15 years. Dr. Pond
      (Temple) a computational evolutionary biologist whose core expertise is
      methodology development (including the HyPhy package) and two decades of
      experience in viral and pathogen evolution (HIV, IAV, and more recently
      SARS-CoV2). Dr. Schatz (Johns Hopkins) is a computational biologist who
      developed widely used algorithms for de-novo genome assembly and variant
      detection as well as pioneered the use of computational clouds in life
      sciences. Dr. Haeussler (UCSC) a software engineer and the PI of the
      Browser Project. Dr. John Fonner, a biomedical engineer who serves as the
      Director of Special Projects at TACC. Importantly, the team consists of
      highly experienced and skilled software developers and engineers who
      worked on the project for many years. Just in the past three years this
      group has published over 40 papers on pathogen genomics including recent
      high profile publications on SARS-CoV2 genomics in
