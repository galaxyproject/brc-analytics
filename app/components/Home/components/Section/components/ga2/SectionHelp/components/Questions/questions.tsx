        <MAccordionDetails>
          We are starting with the set of genomes produced in VGP Phase 1,
          providing easy access to the official assemblies and ENA raw data for
          downstream analysis on the Galaxy Platform. Over time, additional
          genomes will be added, GenomeArk bucket raw data will become
          available, and downstream analysis results will be displayed. You can
          submit your own requests for additional datasets and features at{" "}

        <MAccordionDetails>
          GenomeArk will provide access to genomic data and an analytical
          environment. The data will be based on the official releases provided
          by NCBI Datasets and deployed through the UCSC Genome Browser. The
          analytics will be provided by the Galaxy system supported by powerful
          computational infrastructure provided by the Texas Advanced Computing
          Center (

              typical cluster nodes to large memory machines suitable for genome
              assembly or GPU-containing nodes.
