  If you do not see your organism in this list: it will be there! We are in the
  process of ingesting sequences and annotations for all 785 taxa from
  VEuPathDb. The table below is generated by comparing the list maintained by
  VEuPathDB against official NCBI genome builds. The three buttons adjacent to
  each taxon direct you to a page listing available analytical workflows as well
  as direct links to genomic data (NCBI Datasets) and a genome browser (UCSC). A
  comprehensive search functionality will be developed to allow complex queries.
